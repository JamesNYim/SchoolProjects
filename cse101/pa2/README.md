# Assignment 2: BFS & Shortest Paths (README.md)

## Short description:
The purpose of this program is to utilize a Graph ADT and find the shortest path between verticies.

## Build
	type "make" on the command line with the Makefile provided in the directory

## Running
	type in ./FindPath in the terminal. *as of this current version this does not work*

## Cleaning
	To clean manually, type "rm -f FindPath FindPath.o" on the command line
	Alternatively type "clean" on the command line, using Makefile provided

## Errors:
	This function requires two files. One input and on output file. These files must be in a certain format. The first line is the number of verticies in the graph. The following lines are pairs of verticies seperated by a space. The last line is a placeholder line of just 0's.
	This version of the program is incomplete and does not work.
